## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:
."Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG"
."Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions" 

```{r}
data(mtcars)
```

explore how automatic (am = 0) and manual (am = 1) 
transmissions features affect the MPG feature. The t-test shows that  difference between cars with automatic 
and manual transmission. And it is about 7 MPG more for cars with manual transmission than those with automatic transmission. 
Then, select the one with highest Adjusted R-squared value. So, given that weight 
and mile time are constant, manual transmitted cars are 14.079 + (-4.141)*weight more MPG better than automatic transmitted cars. Thus, cars that are lighter in weight with a manual transmission and cars that are heavier 
in weight with an automatic transmission will have higher MPG values.

#change numeric to factor
```{r}
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)
mtcars$vs <- as.factor(mtcars$vs)
mtcars$am <- factor(mtcars$am)
mtcars$gear <- factor(mtcars$gear)
mtcars$carb <- factor(mtcars$carb)
```
#1.Boxplot of MPG vs. Transmission shows manual transmission yields higher values of MPG in general. 
```{r}
boxplot(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$am, xlab="Transmission (0 = Automatic, 1 = Manual)", ylab="MPG",
        main="Boxplot of MPG vs. Transmission")
```

#Pair Graph of Motor Trend Car Road Tests for each variable
#graph, we can see some higher correlations between variables like "wt", "disp", "cyl" and "hp". 
```{r}
pairs(mtcars, panel=panel.smooth, main="Pair Graph of Motor Car Tests")
```

#we make the null hypothesis as the MPG of the automatic and manual transmissions are from the same population (assuming the MPG has a normal distribution). We use the two sample T-test to show it
```{r}
result <- t.test(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$am)
result$p.value
```
# 0.001373638
```{r}
result$estimate
```
#mean in group 0 mean in group 1 
#       17.14737        24.39231
Since the p-value is 0.00137, we reject our null hypothesis. So, the automatic and manual transmissions are from different populations. And the mean for MPG of manual transmitted cars is about 7 more than that of automatic transmitted cars.


#First, we fit the full model as the following.
```{r}
fullModel <- lm(mpg ~ ., data=mtcars)
summary(fullModel) 
lm(formula = mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)
```
This model has the Residual standard error as 2.833 on 15 degrees of freedom. And the Adjusted R-squared value is 0.779, 
which means that the model can explain about 78% of the variance of the MPG variable. However, none of the coefficients are 
significant at 0.05 significant level.


Then, we use backward selection to select some statistically significant variables.
```{r}
stepModel <- step(fullModel, k=log(nrow(mtcars)))
summary(stepModel) 
```

This model is "mpg ~ wt + qsec + am". It has the Residual standard error as 2.459 on 28 degrees of freedom. And the Adjusted R-squared value is 0.8336, 
which means that the model can explain about 83% of the variance of the MPG variable. All of the coefficients are significant at 0.05 significant level.
as per scatter plot, it indicates that there appear to be an interaction term 
between "wt" variable and "am" variable, since automatic cars tend to weigh heavier than manual cars. Thus, we have the following model including the interaction term:


3.Scatter Plot of MPG vs. Weight by Transmission
```{r}
z.cols<-cut(as.numeric(mtcars$am),2,c("red","blue"))
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, col=as.character(z.cols))
```
According to the scatter plot, it indicates that there appear to be an interaction term between "wt" variable and "am" variable, since automatic cars tend to weigh heavier than manual cars. 
#Thus, we have the following model including the interaction term:
```{r}
amIntWtModel<-lm(mpg ~ wt + qsec + am + wt:am, data=mtcars)
summary(amIntWtModel)
lm(formula = mpg ~ wt + qsec + am + wt:am, data = mtcars)
```
Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
-3.5076 -1.3801 -0.5588  1.0630  4.3684 

#This model has the Residual standard error as 2.084 on 27 degrees of freedom. And the Adjusted R-squared value is 0.8804, which means that the model can explain about 88% of the variance of the MPG variable. 
#All of the coefficients are significant at 0.05 significant level. so this is good

#Next, we fit the simple model with MPG as the outcome variable and Transmission as the predictor variable.
```{r}
amModel<-lm(mpg ~ am, data=mtcars)
summary(amModel)
```
#It shows that on average, a car has 17.147 mpg with automatic transmission, and if it is manual transmission, 7.245 mpg is increased. 
This model has the Residual standard error as 4.902 on 30 degrees of freedom. And the Adjusted R-squared value is 0.3385, which means that the model 
can explain about 34% of the variance of the MPG variable. The low Adjusted R-squared value also indicates that we need to add other variables to the model.


#Finally, we select the final model.
```{r}
anova(amModel, stepModel, fullModel, amIntWtModel) 
```
Model 1: mpg ~ am
Model 2: mpg ~ wt + qsec + am
Model 3: mpg ~ cyl + disp + hp + drat + wt + qsec + vs + am + gear + carb

0=auto 1=manual
Thus, the result shows that when "wt" (weight lb/1000) and "qsec" (1/4 mile time) remain constant, cars with manual transmission add 14.079 + (-4.141)*wt more MPG (miles per gallon) on average than cars with automatic transmission. That is, a manual transmitted car that weighs 2000 lbs have 5.797 more MPG than an automatic transmitted car that has both the same weight and 1/4 mile time.

#1.The Residuals vs. Fitted plot shows no consistent pattern, supporting the accuracy of the independence assumption.
#2.The Normal Q-Q plot indicates that the residuals are normally distributed because the points lie closely to the line.
#3.The Scale-Location plot confirms the constant variance assumption, as the points are randomly distributed.
#4.The Residuals vs. Leverage argues that no outliers are present, as all values fall well within the 0.5 bands.


#As for the Dfbetas, the measure of how much an observation has effected the estimate of a regression coefficient, we get the following result:
```{r}
sum((abs(dfbetas(amIntWtModel)))>1)
```
